# Student-management-System
This project will cover the development and design characteristics of a specific distributed program.

Nowadays, distributed systems are everywhere in the technology world. All of us are dealing with technology 
on a daily basis, but not a lot of us know that most of the portals, websites and applications that we are using,
are part of the client-server world. Huge and powerful servers are out there processing a very considerable amount of requests
from different clients at the same time. 

The topic I have chosen is “Student Management System”. As a student myself I find this topic very relatable. 
The key parts of this report will present the use of a GUI interface for this program and the way it is related to the code.
As we all know this kind of interface is user friendly and easily accessible.
The programming language used in this program is mainly Java which includes imported JavaFX functions. 
Tool used will be Netbeans IDE. 
It is a server-client program which includes 2 sides, the server one and the client one. 
These 2 sides will be interacting with each other through the written Java code to process certain requests from one another.
